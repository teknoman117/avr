Documentation for a2d.h

Example is included under the a2d directory in the Examples directory

---------------Information-------------------------

a2d.h controls the AVR Analog to Digital converter and supports switching
channels and the 10 bit size conversion

ex)
uint16_t cha = getADC(2);

---------------Definitions-------------------------

ADC_PRESCALE        -defined by the prescaler select macro as one of the following to declare the proper prescaler 
ADC_PRESCALE_2      -adc clock = SystemCLK/2
ADC_PRESCALE_4      -adc clock = SystemCLK/4
ADC_PRESCALE_8      -adc clock = SystemCLK/8
ADC_PRESCALE_16     -adc clock = SystemCLK/16
ADC_PRESCALE_32     -adc clock = SystemCLK/32
ADC_PRESCALE_64     -adc clock = SystemCLK/64
ADC_PRESCALE_128    -adc clock = SystemCLK/128

Note:  None of these need to be used by the user because a macro
       decides which prescaler needs to be used for the current
       CPU frequency

--------------Functions------------------------------

void initADC ( void ) -- initalizes the ADC, needs to be called before any other ADC functions are called

uint16_t getADC ( uint8_t channel ) -returns the value of an ADC channel
    -channel - the channel to return the value
