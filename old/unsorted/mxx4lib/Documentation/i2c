---------------Information-------------------------

This header controls the I2C controller inside the AVR.  The functions allow
for all the of the kinds of master control EXCEPT for Multi Master control

---------------Definitions-------------------------

I2C_PRESCALER_1       -prescaler of 1
I2C_PRESCALER_4       -prescaler of 4
I2C_PRESCALER_16      -prescaler of 16
I2C_PRESCALER_64      -prescaler of 64

--------------Functions------------------------------

void init_i2c ( uint8_t bitrate, uint8_t prescaler ) - initalize the I2C controller
    -bitrate - part of the equation to control the bit rate of the I2C controller
    -prescaler - one of the I2C_PRESCALER definitions defining the prescaler
    
int8_t i2c_start ( uint8_t address ) - send a start condition + address
    -address - the address of the I2C slave with the direction bit (even is write, odd is read)
        ex) 0xE0 - write address
        ex) 0xE1 - read address of 0xE0
    -return codes:
     -1 - could not connect or device not ready
     0 - ack received

void i2c_stop ( void ) - generate a stop condition on the I2C bus

int8_t i2c_txb ( uint8_t b ) - write a byte over the I2C bus
    -b - the byte to be transmitted
    -return codes:
     -1 - an error occured, data not acknowledged
     0 - an ACK acknowledgement
     1 - a NACK acknowledgement
     
uint8_t i2c_rxbAck ( void ) - gets a byte off of the I2C bus, sends an ack to the slave, and returns the byte

uint8_t i2c_rxbNack ( void ) - gets a byte off of the I2C bus, sends an nack to the slave, and returns the byte
