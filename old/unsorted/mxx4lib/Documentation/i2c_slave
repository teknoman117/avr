Documentation for i2c_slave.h

Example is included under the i2c_slave directory in the Examples directory

---------------Information-------------------------

This header controls the I2C controller inside the AVR as a slave device.  
It has a buffer array that serves as a buffer that appears as the "registers"
The entire operation is interrupt driven and appears like a 24Cxx type i2c 
eeprom.  To access the data or write the data to have communication all one has to do is to read or write from the i2c_buffer[] array, using the element number as the register

---------------Definitions-------------------------

I2C_PRESCALER_1       -prescaler of 1
I2C_PRESCALER_4       -prescaler of 4
I2C_PRESCALER_16      -prescaler of 16
I2C_PRESCALER_64      -prescaler of 64

I2C_BUFFER_SIZE       -if not redefined, the register number will default 
                       to 32 registers (32 bytes)
					   
I2C_REG_MODE_16BIT    -YOU need to define this if you want the i2c controller
                      -to operate using 16 bit register addresses

--------------Functions------------------------------

void init_i2c_slave ( uint8_t sla, uint8_t bitrate, uint8_t prescaler ) - initalizes the controller
    -sla - the slave address of the AVR, last bit (bit 0 or LSB) is ignored
    -bitrate - the i2c bitrate
    -prescaler - one of the I2C_PRESCALER definitions for the controller's prescaler
