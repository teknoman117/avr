March 1st, 2009 - The ATmegaxx4 (ATmega164, ATmega324, ATmega644) version is mostly complete!

It supports:
  A2D converter
  Analog Comparator w/ multiplexing
  Internal EEPROM reading and writing + multi byte reads and writes
  USART0:
      non-buffered reading and writing (basic)
      non-buffered reading and writing + interface to stdio library (moderate)
      interrupt driven, buffered usart control (writes not buffered) (advanced)
  Timers 0, 1, and 2:
      Normal Timer operation with prescalers and external clock support w/ overflow interrupt enable
      Clear Timer on Compare match with prescalers and external clock support w/ compare match interrupt enable
      Fast Pwm with prescalers
Not Supporting:
   JTAG
   I2C
   SPI
  (coming soon though)

April 24th, 2009 The second version of the library is available!

Added support to:
  Hardware I2C master
  Hardware I2C slave - fully interrupt driven so it will run in the background while your program does what it needs.  
                       Access is achieved by reading and writing to the i2c_buffer[] array with the element number 
                       being the register
					   
Date to be determined The third version of the library is available!
