This is a simple little application I threw together as a demo when I was annoyed by most other RTOS solutions.  Its a work in progress - don't use it for anything important right now.  I'm working on improving the code so its more stable and adding more functionality.  As of now it has the ability to start up and have multiple tasks scheduled to run at regular intervals.  An attributes object is passed to each so potentially you could have one function that does a couple of different things based on whats passed to it.  Tasks have the ability to yield their execution when waiting, but its an unintelligent yield.  It basically gives up all rights to execute until the another of its time periods have elapsed.  Each task gets its own stack, the pointer you pass to it is the END!! of the stack.  

I've released this under the GPL v3 license in hopes that someone finds it useful eventually.  I plan on adding more functionality like mutexes, removing tasks, buffers, don't execute again under such a condition is true, C++ support, etc.  C++ support will be so that it supports the Arduino.  If you have any questions, comments, killer barbecue recipes, etc., my contact info and my webpage are in the AUTHORS file.  I plan on making the source doxygen compatible and including a Doxyfile. 

HOPE YOU ENJOY!
